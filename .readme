A game set in the future where Midori Gurin is brought back to life as a robot/cyborg for an EVIL company
However, she gains conciousness and remembers her past!
She has access to A LOT OF CLONES (did I say a lot) of herself. She can transfer her conciousness between those clones.
This can be utilised to stealthily eliminate the evil scientists and boss of the company!
