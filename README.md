Hello! This out team currently only consists of me and Yakov! We are in desperate need of capable, professional people (unlike us haha! We are just kids with computers)

About this game:
A game set in the future where Midori Gurin is brought back to life as a robot/cyborg for an EVIL company
However, she gains conciousness and remembers her past!
She has access to A LOT OF CLONES (did I say a lot) of herself. She can transfer her conciousness between those clones.
This can be utilised to stealthily eliminate the evil scientists and boss of the company!
